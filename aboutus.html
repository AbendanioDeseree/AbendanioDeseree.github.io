       <h3 style="color: black ;"> Welcome to Seddy's Online Shop, your number one source for all clothing products, house hold products, beauty products and your babies needs.. We're dedicated to giving you the very best quality of our product, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.

      Seddy's Online Shop started last November 2018 by Seddy's Mom DESEREE ABENDANIO, Our online shop has come a long way from its beginnings in a small quantity of products and now this business gives us Seddy's needs. When I first started out, my passion for clothing designs and shopping online helps me save time and money: and I want to help other parents be more practical in their everyday needs, providing the best products for everybody drove me to do intense research while studying and being mother to Seddy, and gave me the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online shop. I now serve customers all over the Philippines, and  hoping to discover all over the world.</h3><br>
